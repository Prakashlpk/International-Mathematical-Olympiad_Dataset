The dataset contains details of the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), with several key columns providing insights into each year's competition. The "No" column represents the serial number of the entry, indicating the order of the event. The "Year" column specifies the year in which the IMO was held, while the "Country" and "City" columns indicate the host country and city where the competition took place. The "Date" column provides the specific dates during which the event occurred. The "Countries" column records the number of participating nations in that year's IMO. The "Contestants All" column represents the total number of students who competed, further categorized into "Male Contestants" and "Female Contestants", which show the gender distribution of participants.
One notable trend observable from the dataset is that the number of participants has generally increased as the years have progressed. This suggests a growing interest in the competition and an expanding international reach.
However, while we can analyse patterns and trends within the data, we cannot consider the column "Contestants All" (total number of participants) as a target variable. A target variable in supervised learning is typically the outcome we aim to predict based on other features. In this dataset, there is no explicitly defined dependent variable that we are trying to predict. The dataset is primarily observational, recording historical trends without labelling a specific column as the outcome to be predicted.
Since there is no target variable, this dataset falls under the category of unsupervised learning rather than supervised learning.
